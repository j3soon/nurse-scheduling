# Timeline

A list of major milestones in the development of the project. For a visual overview of codebase activity, see the [code frequency plot](https://github.com/j3soon/nurse-scheduling/graphs/code-frequency).

- **2025-11-14**: Successfully reused the pre-created template, with a non-developer assistant user filling in the actual data, and validated by head nurses and put into use with minimal adjustments.
- **2025-10**: Successfully applied to three real-world complex multi-ward scenarios involving ~100 nurses. The developer created ward templates via the web GUI, populated them with real data, and iteratively refined them with head nurses feedback. The final outputs were validated and put into use with minimal adjustments.
- **2025-09**: Begin attempting to apply to real-world scenarios.
- **2025-08-14**: Basic version of web frontend GUI for developer usage (commit [9a6f414](https://github.com/j3soon/nurse-scheduling/commit/9a6f4141eb485db0ffb2ec10a9cbc74a3b4c4f46)).
- **2025-08-12**: Basic version of refactored CLI capable of handling the CLI prototype scenario (commit [bc6dc47](https://github.com/j3soon/nurse-scheduling/commit/bc6dc475c1a941d99dae03ddd822c31270103f4e)).
- **2023-08-20**: Proof of concept (POC) verified by domain experts under a multi-ward scenario with a CLI prototype.
- **2023-08-13**: First commit.
